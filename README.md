| *The user interface of the application* |

### Requirements from the user
- System matrices
  - Mass matrix
  - Stiffness matrix
  - Linear damping matrix
  - Structural damping matrix
- Nonlinearities with type of it (gap nonlinearity) 

### How to use
The user provides the above-mentinoned system matrices in a text-file as in the sample file.

### How it works
Utilizing modal superposition method.
